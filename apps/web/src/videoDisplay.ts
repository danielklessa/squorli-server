 * What LiveKit's adaptiveStream needs to know about a video view in a POP-OUT window, reported from that window.

 * (`root: null`). Firefox never reports an element of another window as intersecting (the implicit root is the observer's
 * own top-level document), so adaptiveStream took the pop-out for invisible and paused the track: the camera froze on its
 * first frames as soon as it was popped out (user's report, 18 September 2026). Chrome measures against the element's own
 * document and was fine. Registered before `attach()`, so LiveKit skips its own info for the element.
